**What is Hyperledger Bevel?**

  Hyperledger Bevel is an automation framework for delivering consistent production ready DLT networks on cloud based infrastructures, enabling teams to deliver without the need to architect the solution from scratch.
  
  Hyperledger Bevel  provides 3 key features:

    * Security: Bevel provides a secure environment for DLT development. Bevel  has best practices of key management and other security features available by default.
    * Scalability: Bevel has a scalable network implementation, a user can easily scale the environment and resources according to his/her needs.
    * Acceleration: Bevel will help in providing a blockchain solution that drives acceleration up to deployment providing an oppourtunity to participate in those deliveries and drive more services.
  
  It is an accelerator for all the developers to be able to use a DLT network right away.
  So with Hyperledger Bevel, users are able to create a DLT environment and know that it is something that will continue to be used as
  project management.
