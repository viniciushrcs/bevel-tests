# Adding a new validator organization in Besu

  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [Create Configuration File](#create-configuration-file)
  - [Run playbook](#run-playbook)

<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
To add a new organization in Besu, an existing besu network should be running, enode information of all existing nodes present in the network should be available, genesis file should be available in base64 encoding and the information of orion nodes and existing validator nodes should be available. The new node account should be unlocked prior adding the new node to the existing besu network. 

---
**NOTE**: Addition of a new organization has been tested on an existing network which is created by Bevel. Networks created using other methods may be suitable but this has not been tested by Bevel team.

## Create Configuration File

Refer [this guide](./besu_networkyaml.md) for details on editing the configuration file.

The `network.yaml` file should contain the specific `network.organization` details along with the orion transaction manager node details and existing validator and member node details.

---
**NOTE**: Make sure that the genesis flie is provided in base64 encoding. Also, if you are adding node to the same cluster as of another node, make sure that you add the ambassador ports of the existing node present in the cluster to the network.yaml

---
For reference, sample `network.yaml` file looks like below for IBFT consensus (but always check the latest network-besu-new-validatororg.yaml at `platforms/hyperledger-besu/configuration/samples`):

```

# This is a sample configuration file to add a new validator organization to existing network.
# This DOES NOT support proxy=none
# All text values are case-sensitive

# Network level configuration specifies the attributes required for each organization to join an existing network.
  type: besu

#Environment section for Kubernetes setup

    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for besu
    ## Any additional Ambassador ports can be given below, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
    # These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports
    # This sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. 
    # These ports are again specified for each organization below
    ambassadorPorts:
      portRange:                    # For a range of ports

## Run playbook

The [add-validator.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/tree/main/platforms/hyperledger-besu/configuration/add-validator.yaml) playbook is used to add a new validator organization to the existing network. This can be done using the following command

```
ansible-playbook platforms/hyperledger-besu/configuration/add-validator.yaml --extra-vars "@path-to-network.yaml" --extra-vars "add_new_org='true'"
```
