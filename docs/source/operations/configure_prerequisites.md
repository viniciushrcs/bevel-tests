## GitOps Authentication
For synchronizing the Git repo with the cluster, Hyperledger Bevel configures Flux for each cluster. The authentication is via SSH or HTTPS which can be specified in the configuration file `gitops.protocol` section. 

For **HTTPS**, just generate a git token and give that read-write access. Keep the token safe and use in the `gitops.password` section of the [configuration file](./corda_networkyaml.md). 

For **SSH**, run the following command to generate a private-public key pair named **gitops**.

```
ssh-keygen -q -N "" -f ./gitops
```

The above command generates an SSH key-pair: **gitops** (private key) and **gitops.pub** (public key).

Use the path to the private key (**gitops**) in the `gitops.private_key` section of the [configuration file](./corda_networkyaml.md).

---
**NOTE:** Ensure that the Ansible host has read-access to the private key file (gitops).

---

And add the public key contents (starts with **ssh-rsa**) as an Access Key (with read-write permissions) in your Github repository by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

## Unseal Hashicorp Vault 

The [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) service should be accessible by the ansible controller as well as the kubernetes cluster (proper inbound/outbound rules should be configured). If not initialised and unsealed already, complete the following steps to unseal and access the Vault.

* Install Vault client. Follow the instructions on [Install Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/).

* Set the environment Variable **VAULT_ADDR** as the Vault service. 

```
export VAULT_ADDR=http://my-vault-server:9000
```
---
**NOTE** The port should be accessible from the host where you are running this command from, as well as the Ansible controller and the Kubernetes nodes.

---
* Now execute the following:
```
vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
```
It will give following output:
```
Unseal Key 1: << unseal key>>

Initial Root Token: << root token>>
```
Save the root token  and unseal key in a secure location. This root token is to be updated in Hyperledger Bevel's network.yaml file before running the Ansible playbook(s) to deploy the DLT/Blockchain network.

* Unseal with the following command:
```
vault operator unseal << unseal-key-from-above >>
```
* Run this command to check if Vault is unsealed: 
```
vault status
```

---
**NOTE**: It is recommended to use Vault auto-unseal using Cloud KMS for Production Systems. And also, rotate the root token regularly.

## Docker Images

Hyperledger Bevel provides pre-built docker images which are available on [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/packages?repo_name=bevel). Ensure that the versions/tags you need are available. If not, raise it on our [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/941475087389950002).

For Corda Enterprise, the docker images should be built and put in a private docker registry. Please follow [these instructions](../architectureref/corda-ent.html#docker-images) to build docker images for Corda Enterprise.

---
**NOTE:** Hyperledger Bevel recommends use of private docker registry for production use. The username/password for the docker registry can be provided in a **network.yaml** file so that the Kubernetes cluster can access the registry.

## DNS Update

Hyperledger Bevel uses [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/about/why-ambassador/) or [HAProxy Ingress Controller](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/1-9r1/traffic-management/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) (for Fabric) for inter-cluster communication. 
Bevel automation deploys both as per the configuration provided in `network.env.proxy` section of the Bevel configuration file, but if you are not using [External DNS](#externaldns), you will have to manually add DNS entries.


* After Ambassador/HAProxy is deployed on the cluster (manually or using `platforms/shared/configuration/kubernetes-env-setup.yaml` playbook), get the external IP address of the Ambassador/HAProxy service.

    ```
    kubectl get services -o wide
    ```
    The output of the above command will look like this:
    ![Ambassador Service Output](../_static/ambassador-service.png)

* Copy the **EXTERNAL-IP** for **ambassador** service from the output.
---
**NOTE:** If Ambassador is configured by the playbook, then this configuration has to be done while the playbook is being executed, otherwise the deployment will fail.

---

* Configure your subdomain configuration to redirect the external DNS name to this external IP. For example, if you want to configure the external domain suffix as **test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com**, then update the DNS mapping to redirect all requests to ***.test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com** towards **EXTERNAL-IP** from above as an ALIAS.
In AWS Route53, the settings look like below (in Hosted Zones).
![Ambassador DNS Configuration](../_static/ambassador-dns.png)

---
**NOTE:** Ambassador for AWS and AWS-baremetal expose Hyperledger Indy nodes via a TCP Network Load Balancer with a fixed IP address. The fixed IP address is used as EIP allocation ID for all steward public IPs found in the network.yaml. The same public IP is specified for all stewards within one organization. All ports used by Indy nodes in the particular organization have to be exposed.

## External DNS

In case you do not want to manually update the route configurations every time you change DNS name, you can use [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) for automatic updation of DNS routes. 
Follow the steps as per your cloud provider, and then use `external_dns: enabled` in the `env` section of the Bevel configuration file (network.yaml).

---
**NOTE:** Detailed configuration for External DNS setup is not provided here, please refer the link above.
